# Hi there, 👋 I'm Hicham Nasse Lahsen

Full stack Web developer, Designer and Freelancer

I am a Web Designer, and Devlopper with years of experience in Agadir, Morocco on my back; I have now been building delightful digital experiences for over 8+ years. My experience is in coding and design, combined with the ability to convert ideas into interactive online experiences. I see the web as one big canvas and do not separate design from functionality but position both to be together in a way that emphasizes our interactions with websites. I try to innovate and find simplicity in every project. Let me hear about your project and we can start working together to make sure that your dream shines bright within the realm of digital.
